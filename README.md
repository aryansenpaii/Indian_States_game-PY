# Indian_States_game-PY

A fun Python game to test your knowledge of Indian states! The game uses the Turtle module for a graphical interface and Pandas for managing the state data.

## Features

- Interactive map of India where players guess the names of states.
- As you guess a state correctly, its name appears on its respective location on the map.
- Keeps track of your guesses visually on the map.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Indian_States_game-PY.git
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. The game will display a map of India. Enter the name of a state to guess its location. Correct guesses will display the state's name on the map!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (comes pre-installed with Python)
- Pandas library

You can install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Files

- `main.py`: The main game file that runs the application.
- `states_data.csv`: Data file containing the names and coordinates of Indian states.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more game modes, such as time challenges or tracking incorrect guesses.
- Improve map accuracy and interactivity.
